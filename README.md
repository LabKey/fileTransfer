The fileTransfer module provides user interface for displaying files, their metadata, and download links to a [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) endpoint.  The user interface (a web part that wraps a List) checks a local file directory for the availability of files. It is assumed that the local file directory has a network connection to a Globus endpoint.
